            <p>First of all, please make sure you have copied the correct Business ID from your OPIO business dashboard, it's typically english alphabets with about 17 characters in length, and please make sure your actual feed works by browsing it in your OPIO Dashboard</p>

            <p>Please make sure you have a valid organization ID, and it's not a OPIO Business ID. From the full installation guide you can see that finding business ID and organization ID from your OPIO dashboard has couple of differences, please make sure you follow the guidelines properly</p>

            <h3>Is the plugin compatible with the latest version of PHP? I saw warnings about the compatibility with PHP 7 in the checker plugin.</h3>
            <p>Yes, the plugin is absolutely compatible with PHP 7 and by the way, we are using PHP 7 on the demo site.</p>
            <p>The warnings come from the code which is needed for compatible with old versions of PHP (&lt; 5.0) which is sometimes found in some users and without this code, the plugin will not work.</p>
            <p>The problem is that the plugin which youâ€™re using to test compatibility with PHP 7 cannot understand that this code is not used under PHP 7 or greater. The compatibility plugin just search some keywords which deprecated in the latest version PHP and show warnings about it (without understanding that this is not used).</p>
